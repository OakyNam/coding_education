### Lab Exercise: Installing Python

**Objective**: By the end of this lab, you will be able to install Python on your computer and verify the installation.

---

#### Prerequisites

- A computer with internet access.
- Administrative privileges to install software.

---

### Part 1: Downloading Python

**Step 1: Open Your Web Browser**

- Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

**Step 2: Navigate to the Python Download Page**

- Go to the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Step 3: Download the Installer**

- You will see a button for the latest version of Python (e.g., "Download Python 3.x.x"). Click on this button to download the installer.

### Part 2: Installing Python on Windows

**Step 4: Run the Installer**

- Locate the downloaded installer (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run.

**Step 5: Customize Installation (Optional)**

- On the installation screen, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This is important for running Python from the command line.
- Click on **"Customize installation"** if you want to select optional features (like pip, documentation, etc.), or click **"Install Now"** to proceed with the default installation.

**Step 6: Complete the Installation**

- Wait for the installation to complete. Once finished, you will see a screen that says "Setup was successful." Click **"Close"**.

### Part 3: Installing Python on macOS

**Step 4: Run the Installer**

- Locate the downloaded `.pkg` installer file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run.

**Step 5: Follow the Installation Wizard**

- Follow the prompts in the installation wizard. Click **"Continue"** to proceed through the steps.
- You may need to agree to the license agreement and select the installation location (the default is usually fine).

**Step 6: Complete the Installation**

- Click **"Install"** to begin the installation. You may be prompted to enter your macOS password.
- Once the installation is complete, click **"Close"**.

### Part 4: Installing Python on Linux

**Step 4: Open Terminal**

- Open your terminal application.

**Step 5: Update Package List**

- Before installing Python, update your package list by running:

```bash
sudo apt update  # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
```

**Step 6: Install Python**

- Run the following command to install Python 3:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

- You may also want to install `pip`, the package manager for Python:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

---

### Part 5: Verifying the Installation

**Step 7: Open Command Line or Terminal**

- Open Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (macOS), or your terminal application (Linux).

**Step 8: Check Python Version**

- Run the following command to check if Python is installed and to see the version:

```bash
python --version  # or python3 --version on macOS/Linux
```

- You should see output indicating the version of Python installed (e.g., `Python 3.x.x`).

**Step 9: Check pip Version**

- Run the following command to check if `pip` is installed:

```bash
pip --version  # or pip3 --version on macOS/Linux
```

- You should see output indicating the version of `pip` installed.

---

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Python on your computer and verified the installation. You are now ready to start programming in Python.

### Optional Challenge

- Explore the Python documentation at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/) to learn more about Python features and libraries.
- Try writing a simple Python script to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
